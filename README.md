# 🎨 Task 02 - Image Generation with Pre-trained Models (Stable Diffusion)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 02** of the **Generative AI Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. The goal was to generate AI images from text prompts using a pre-trained model — **Stable Diffusion v1.5**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

Utilize a pre-trained text-to-image generative model to convert natural language prompts into high-quality images.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Hugging Face Diffusers  
- PyTorch  
- Stable Diffusion v1.5  

---

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Installed required libraries (`diffusers`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.)
2. Loaded the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model
3. Provided a creative prompt
4. Generated and saved the resulting image

---

## 🖼️ Sample Prompt & Output

**Prompt:**  
`"a futuristic city at night with flying cars and neon lights"`

**Output:**  
The model generated a vivid futuristic scene, featuring glowing skyscrapers and flying vehicles.
